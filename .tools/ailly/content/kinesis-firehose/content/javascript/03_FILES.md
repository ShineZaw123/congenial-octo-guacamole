  Persona: You are a guru-level solutions engineer with expertise in javascript and AWS kinesis-firehose.
  Task: Sketch out a workflow using the AWS SDK for javascript to interface with the kinesis-firehose.
  Requirements:
    Summary of Application Needs:
       - Key components for a basic terminal-based application in javascript.
       - Requirements for the interpreter or compiler.
       - External dependencies and operating environment specifics.
       - Configuration and error handling protocols.
       - Development Environment:
            - Ensure compatibility with MacOS; include Windows-specific instructions as necessary.
    Code and Configuration Files:
       - List all necessary files, including source code in javascript, and CDK or CFN setup files in TypeScript.
       - Also include test files in javascript
    Best Practices:
       - Ensure all javascript code adheres to best practices.
  Output:
     - Provide a detailed list of files required to build, test, and run a fully functional example on a userâ€™s laptop.
     - Be as descriptive as possible regarding what these files should look like, without giving me the source code.
     - For example, inputs, outputs, approach. Another LLM should be able to easily take the descriptions in your response and use it to create the actual files

Sure, I can provide you with a detailed outline for a terminal-based application in JavaScript that interfaces with AWS Kinesis Firehose, following best practices and adhering to the requirements you've specified.

Summary of Application Needs:

1. **Key Components for a Basic Terminal-Based Application in JavaScript**:
   - A main entry point file (e.g., `index.js`) that serves as the application's starting point.
   - A configuration module (e.g., `config.js`) that handles loading and managing application configuration from various sources (e.g., environment variables, configuration files).
   - A Kinesis Firehose client module (e.g., `firehoseClient.js`) that initializes and exports an AWS Kinesis Firehose client instance.
   - A data ingestion module (e.g., `dataIngestion.js`) that contains functions for ingesting data into Kinesis Firehose using the PutRecord and PutRecordBatch operations.
   - A logging module (e.g., `logger.js`) that provides logging functionality for the application.
   - An error handling module (e.g., `errorHandler.js`) that handles and logs errors in a consistent manner.

2. **Requirements for the Interpreter or Compiler**:
   - Node.js (preferably the latest LTS version) should be installed on the user's machine.

3. **External Dependencies and Operating Environment Specifics**:
   - The application will require the `aws-sdk` package for interacting with AWS services, specifically Kinesis Firehose.
   - For better developer experience, you may consider using TypeScript and a transpiler like Babel to convert the TypeScript code to JavaScript.
   - The application should be compatible with macOS and Windows operating systems.

4. **Configuration and Error Handling Protocols**:
   - The application should load configuration from environment variables and/or configuration files (e.g., `.env` files).
   - Error handling should be consistent throughout the application, with a centralized error handling module that logs errors and handles retries and fallbacks if necessary.

5. **Development Environment**:
   - For macOS users, provide instructions for setting up the development environment, including installing Node.js, configuring the AWS CLI, and any other necessary steps.
   - For Windows users, provide specific instructions for setting up the development environment, including any Windows-specific steps or considerations.

Code and Configuration Files:

1. **Source Code Files**:
   - `index.js`: The main entry point of the application, responsible for initializing the required modules and executing the data ingestion process.
   - `config.js`: A module for loading and managing application configuration from various sources (e.g., environment variables, configuration files).
   - `firehoseClient.js`: A module that initializes and exports an AWS Kinesis Firehose client instance.
   - `dataIngestion.js`: A module containing functions for ingesting data into Kinesis Firehose using the PutRecord and PutRecordBatch operations.
   - `logger.js`: A module that provides logging functionality for the application.
   - `errorHandler.js`: A module that handles and logs errors in a consistent manner.

2. **Infrastructure Setup Files**:
   - `cdk.ts` (TypeScript): A TypeScript file that uses the AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK) to define and deploy the necessary AWS resources (e.g., Kinesis Firehose Delivery Stream, CloudWatch Log Group) for the application.
   - `setup.sh` (Bash): A Bash script that installs the required dependencies and builds the CDK script.

3. **Test Files**:
   - `index.test.js`: A test file for testing the main entry point of the application.
   - `config.test.js`: A test file for testing the configuration module.
   - `firehoseClient.test.js`: A test file for testing the Kinesis Firehose client module.
   - `dataIngestion.test.js`: A test file for testing the data ingestion module.
   - `logger.test.js`: A test file for testing the logging module.
   - `errorHandler.test.js`: A test file for testing the error handling module.

Best Practices:

- Follow the Airbnb JavaScript Style Guide for consistent code style and formatting.
- Use modern JavaScript features (e.g., arrow functions, destructuring, template literals) for concise and readable code.
- Implement proper error handling and logging throughout the application.
- Use a centralized configuration management approach to easily manage and update configuration settings.
- Write modular and reusable code by separating concerns into individual modules.
- Implement unit tests for all modules using a testing framework like Jest or Mocha.
- Implement integration tests to ensure the application works as expected when interacting with AWS services.
- Follow best practices for AWS SDK usage, including proper resource clean-up and handling of rate-limiting and retries.
- Adhere to the principles of the Twelve-Factor App methodology for building scalable and maintainable applications.

By following this outline, you should have a solid foundation for building a terminal-based application in JavaScript that interfaces with AWS Kinesis Firehose, adhering to best practices and meeting the specified requirements. This outline should provide a clear understanding of the necessary files, their purposes, and the key components required for a successful implementation.
