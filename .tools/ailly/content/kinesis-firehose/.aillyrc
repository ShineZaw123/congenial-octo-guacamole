Task: Develop reference code using the Kinesis Firehose service for PutRecord and PutRecordBatch operations, focusing on production-grade reliability and performance.

Requirements:
1. Batch Sizing:
- Address batch limits, pricing, and throughput considerations.
- Explain the rationale behind these choices in the code comments.

2. Code Features:
- Implement robust error handling, logging, and pagination.
- Incorporate exception handling with a retry mechanism featuring exponential back-off with jitter for PutRecord and PutRecordBatch.
- Ensure PutRecordBatch checks FailedPutCount in responses.

3. Monitoring:
- If using DirectPut, monitor IncomingBytes and IncomingRecords to assess traffic.

4. Supporting Infrastructure and Documentation:
- Include a TypeScript CDK script for creating necessary AWS resources.
- Provide a README.md detailing setup and execution instructions.
- Develop the sample code in a single executable file for CLI use, demonstrating SDK operations.

# Workflow
1. Set up the stream using the CDK script.
2. Demonstrate putting a single record with comprehensive error handling and logging.
3. Extend to batch record processing.
4. Include additional scenarios relevant to the main operations.
